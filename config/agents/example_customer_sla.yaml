# Customer SLA-driven configuration example
#
# Shows how customers configure agents based on their SLA requirements.
# They can easily switch between inline and async based on performance testing.

agents:
  # Scenario 1: Tight SLA (50ms) - only fast inline agents
  fast_ml_scorer:
    class: "agents.examples.FastMLScorerAgent"
    enabled: true
    execution_mode: "inline"  # Must be inline for tight SLA
    timeout: 0.05  # 50ms strict limit
    threshold: 0.0
  
  # All enrichment runs async - doesn't block pipeline
  narrative_enrichment:
    class: "agents.examples.NarrativeAgent"
    enabled: true
    execution_mode: "async"  # Background processing
    timeout: 60
    threshold: 0.6
  
  alert_generator:
    class: "agents.examples.AlertGeneratorAgent"
    enabled: true
    execution_mode: "async"  # Background processing
    timeout: 30
    threshold: 0.8
  
  # Scenario 2: Relaxed SLA (500ms) - can run some enrichment inline
  # Uncomment if SLA allows:
  #
  # quick_narrative:
  #   class: "agents.examples.QuickNarrativeAgent"
  #   enabled: true
  #   execution_mode: "inline"  # Fast enough for 500ms SLA
  #   timeout: 0.2  # 200ms
  #   threshold: 0.7
