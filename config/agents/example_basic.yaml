# Basic agent configuration example
#
# This shows the minimal configuration needed to use agents.
# Customers can copy and modify this for their pipeline.

agents:
  # Fast risk scoring agent - runs inline in pipeline
  risk_scorer:
    class: "agents.examples.RiskScoringAgent"
    enabled: true
    execution_mode: "inline"  # Fast enough to run synchronously
    timeout: 5  # 5 seconds max
    threshold: 0.5  # Apply to transactions with score > 0.5
  
  # Narrative generation agent - runs async (doesn't block pipeline)
  narrative:
    class: "agents.examples.NarrativeAgent"
    enabled: true
    execution_mode: "async"  # Runs in background
    timeout: 30  # 30 seconds max
    threshold: 0.7  # Only for high-risk transactions (score > 0.7)
