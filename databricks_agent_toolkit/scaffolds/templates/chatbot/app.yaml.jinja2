# Databricks Apps Configuration
#
# Apps use serverless compute managed at the workspace level.
# Compute size and resource tags are controlled by workspace-level
# serverless compute policies, not in bundle configuration.
#
# To configure compute and tags:
# 1. Contact your workspace admin to set up serverless compute policies
# 2. Policies can enforce tags for cost tracking and resource attribution
# 3. See: https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/admin/usage/budget-policies
#
# The 'resources' and 'config' sections shown in DABs documentation
# apply to other resource types (jobs, pipelines), not Apps.
